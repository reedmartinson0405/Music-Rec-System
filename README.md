# I have been hired by Apple Music to help improve their recommendation system and keep users engaged on their streaming service. Spotify, a competitor streaming service, has the best experience for the user when it comes to recommending songs and making playlists. Spotify leads the streaming platforms with over 400 million users and over 150 million premium subscirbers. Apple Music is at 88 million subscribers. With an improved recommendation system, I believe Apple Music can start to close the gap with Spotify.
